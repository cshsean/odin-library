# Odin Library

A simple library web app where users can add books, view their details, and remove them. This project was built as part of The Odin Project curriculum to practice JavaScript and DOM manipulation fundamentals.

## Features

- Add books with title, author, page count, and status
- Remove books from the view
- Responsive and interactive UI using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- Dynamically updates the DOM without page reloads

## What I Learned

- Basic **DOM manipulation** using JavaScript
- Retrieving and validating user input from HTML **forms**
- Creating **constructor functions** to manage data (Book objects)
- Using **event listeners** to trigger modal pop-ups and UI updates
- Building a clean, dark-themed UI using **Flexbox** and modern **CSS**

## Future Improvements

- Implement **persistent state** using:
  - `localStorage` for simple persistence
  - A **backend/database** for more scalable data handling
- Add ability to **edit** a book or toggle its read status
- Add **form validation** and feedback for bad input
- Expand to include **search or filter** functionality
- Add **responsive design enhancements** for mobile users

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, transitions)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
